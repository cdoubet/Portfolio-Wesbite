# Portfolio Website 

This is the personal portfolio website of Charlie Doubet, created as the final project for my Digital Process Management class.

## About the Website

The website serves as a digital resume and professional profile. It provides an overview of who I am, including:

- A short biography
- My professional experiences
- A list of technical and interpersonal skills
- Personal interests and hobbies

It was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** for responsive design and styling. The site also includes basic compliance pages such as a cookie policy, privacy policy, and terms of use.

## How to Access

You can view the live version of the website by visiting [charliedoubet.com](https://charliedoubet.com). From there, you can explore the different pages and learn more about me.

If you're interested in the source code, you can navigate through this GitHub repository to see how the site was built.

## Features

- **Responsive Design** for desktop and mobile users
- **Resume Viewer** with downloadable PDF
- **Cookie Consent Popup** for legal compliance
- **Custom Favicon and Icons** for branding
- **Structured Navigation** between home, resume, terms, and policies

## Technologies Used
